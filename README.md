## Abstract
This project investigates the effects of five classical 2D attention modules (**Non-local, Criss-cross, SE, CBAM, Dual-attention**) and five novel 3D attention modules (**A-SCN, Point-Attention, CAA, Offset-Attention, Point-Transformer**) in 3D point cloud object detection, based on VoteNet pipeline.
